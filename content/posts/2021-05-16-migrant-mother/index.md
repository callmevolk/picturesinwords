*Migrant Mother - taken by Dorothea Lange*

This iconic image of the Great Depression was taken by Dorothea Lange in an effort to raise awareness of the conditions farmers lived in. The woman in the image is Florence Owens Thompson, and the Library of Congress titled the image as: "*Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age thirty-two. Nipomo, California.*" 

### The sad story behind the images

On that fateful day, Florence was on her way to find work in the lettuce fields of the Pajaro Valley with her family. Due to their car malfunctioning, they coasted to a stop just inside a pea-pickers' camp on Nipomo Mesa, only to be shocked at how many people were camping there—as many as 2,500 to 3,500. They quickly found out that the crops had been destroyed by rain, leaving them with no work or pay and little to no food.

When asked about her experience in an interview years later, Florence recalled a sad memory of cooking for her children one day, when other people's children from the pea pickers' camp approached asking, "*Can I have a bite?*"

The photograph was taken when Florence's partner and two of their sons went into town to get parts to repair the car. Lange took 7 photos in 10 minutes, but having been in a hurry to get home after a month on assignment, on this day her field notes weren't really thorough as they usually were.

Lange wrote 23 years later about the unusual encounter, saying:

> "I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was 32. She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food."

One of Florence's sons later refuted that claim, saying that there's no way they sold their tires, but agreed with everything else.

### Events influenced by the images

According to Florence, the photographs were not meant to be published, saying that Lange even promised that she wound't publish them. Lange, however, had other ideas, as she sent them to the *San Francisco News* before even sending them to the *Resettlement Administration* in Washington, D.C. The *San Francisco News* ran the pictures almost immediately and reported that [2,500 to 3,500 migrant workers were starving in Nipomo](https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20021112-2002-11-12-0211120007-story.html).

Thanks to this, the camp recieved 9100 kg of food from the federal government within days. Florence and her family, however, had already moved on to work elsewhere before the food arrived.

### Aftermath

The photograph earned its legendary status as one of the most iconic images of the Great Depression, but it took a long time before the person behind it was identified, since Lange never asked for a name. When discovered in the late '70s, Florence was quoted as saying: "*I wish she \[Lange] hadn't taken my picture. I can't get a penny out of it. She didn't ask my name. She said she wouldn't sell the pictures. She said she'd send me a copy. She never did."*

Lange didn't earn any money from it either as the photograph was public domain, but she did earn respect in her field and the image is considered as the greatest image Lange had ever taken.

Florence died on September 16, 1983 at the age of 80. Her gravestone reads "*FLORENCE LEONA THOMPSON Migrant Mother – A Legend of the Strength of American Motherhood.*"

In a 2008 interview with CNN, Florence's daughter recalled how her mother was a "very strong lady", and "the backbone of our family", saying: "*We never had a lot, but she always made sure we had something. She didn't eat sometimes, but she made sure us children ate. That's one thing she did do*."
